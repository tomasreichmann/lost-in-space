# Illuminated Cryo Pod

You slowly regain consciousness, realizing you are in a cryo pod. You see a crack in the glass lid of the pod, and a small amount of air is blowing in, misting the air. As you look down at yourself, you notice a large piece of metal sticking out of your side. Your blood has already seeped into the fabric of your suit, creating a large red circle around the wound. It is slowly growing.
